## Overview

Explore the fundamental principles of DevOps through a project that demonstrates key concepts such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Leveraging the power of GitHub Actions, this project serves as a practical guide to implementing seamless automation in your development workflow.

## Key Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Embrace the paradigm shift towards IaC, allowing you to manage and provision infrastructure through code. The project provides an example of defining infrastructure components as code, promoting consistency and scalability.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Learn how to automate the build, test, and deployment phases of your application with CI/CD pipelines. GitHub Actions streamline these processes, enabling you to deliver software faster and more reliably.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized to highlight:

- IaC scripts for provisioning and managing infrastructure.
- CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
